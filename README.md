# PRODIGY_GA_03

# 📌 Markov Chain Text Generator

## A simple Python project that generates text using Markov Chains.
## Built as Task-3 of Internship to demonstrate probabilistic text generation and clean project structure.

### 🔹 What This Project Does:

Learns word patterns from a text file

Predicts the next word based on previous word(s)

Generates new text using probability (Markov Chain logic)

### 🧠 How Markov Chain Works (Simple):

Each word (or group of words) remembers which words come after it.

Example:

"machine learning" → "is", "helps"


The next word is chosen randomly from learned options.

### ⚙️ How to Run:

### 1️⃣ Clone the repo:
git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/PRODIGY_GA_03.git
cd PRODIGY_GA_03

### 2️⃣ Run the project:
python main.py
